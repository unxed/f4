// What the panels need from the application above them.
//
// The largest of these is AppCommand. A frame command the panel raises — copy,
// rename, open the settings — is answered by the action table, which lives at
// layer 4 and reaches back into every subsystem. The panel keeps the switch
// that decides *which* command it is, because that is its own dispatch order,
// and hands the ones it does not serve itself to the root with the frame it
// was raised on. Passing the frame matters: HandleCommand can reach a frame
// that is not the active one, and looking it up again would answer for the
// wrong panels.
//
// The root fills these in. Every default is inert: an unwired panel declines
// the command and shows no menu, which is wrong in a way somebody notices.
